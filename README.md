# Spreading disease through the airs
This project aims to simulate how disease spread in a network using flight routes.
Then it will try to find an optimal strategy to spread disease as efficient as possible. **Do not read it with malicious purpose.**
## Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
You firstly need to have the same environment as ntds_2018 (can be found [here](https://github.com/mdeff/ntds_2018))

Then you will also need to add Basemap. you can run the following command on a terminal:

`conda install -c anaconda basemap`

#### Deployment
You will then need to run `Spreading_disease.ipynb`
All cells are already run once. You can for sure run it again, if you downloaded the required dataset (can be found [here](https://openflights.org/data.html))

## Architecture
#### >data
this is the folder containing needed dataset.
#### >milestones
In this folder you will find all past milestones needed for the course ntds_2018
#### -Spreading_disease.ipynb
Main notebook containing the whole project. This is the only file you need to look at
#### -spreading.mp4
A short animation of how disease propagate in the network. it uses `codec=h264` so you might need a software such as `vlc`. It is generated thanks to the notebook `Spreading_disease.ipynb`.
#### -License
The license
#### -README
The file you are reading right now.
